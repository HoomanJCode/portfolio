            "content_html": "<p>This is my simple UnityGameEngine menu management tool and I want to share it with my friends. You can Create some Menus and switch between them and manage them at multiple layers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Managing menus efficiently in Unity can be challenging, especially when dealing with a single scene. To simplify this process, I created <strong>MenuView-Package</strong>, a simple and effective menu management tool for Unity Game Engine. With this tool, you can create menus, switch between them quickly using button functions, and manage them across different layers effortlessly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-created-menuview-package\">Why I Created MenuView-Package</h2>\n<p>When developing games in Unity, I often found handling menus within a single scene to be cumbersome. Unity’s built-in UI management system requires manual toggling of GameObjects and tracking menu states, which can lead to unstructured and inefficient code.</p>\n<p>I created <strong>MenuView-Package</strong> to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a <strong>structured and simple way</strong> to manage menus within a single scene.</li>\n<li>Allow developers to <strong>switch between menus instantly</strong> via button functions.</li>\n<li>Offer <strong>a reusable and scalable approach</strong> to menu navigation.</li>\n<li>Reduce the need for <strong>manual UI state tracking</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With MenuView-Package, handling menus within a single scene becomes seamless, making it easier to maintain and extend UI systems in Unity projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-it-does-how-it-simplifies-menu-handling\">What It Does &amp; How It Simplifies Menu Handling</h2>\n<p>MenuView-Package provides an efficient way to create and manage multiple menus in Unity. It allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create menus easily</strong> by inheriting from <code>MenuView</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Switch between menus dynamically</strong> with simple commands.</li>\n<li><strong>Manage menus across multiple layers</strong>, ensuring structured navigation.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid redundant UI state management</strong>, as the package keeps track of the last active view.</li>\n<li><strong>Call functions in UI buttons</strong> to switch menus rapidly without extra logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By handling menu navigation programmatically, this tool significantly reduces UI-related complexity and ensures a smoother development process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Using MenuView-Package is straightforward. Follow these steps to integrate it into your Unity project:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-importing-the-package\">1. Importing the Package</h3>\n<p>To use MenuView-Package, you need to import it via the Unity Package Manager:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open <strong>Unity Package Manager</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Add package from git URL: <a href=\"https://github.com/HoomanJCode/MenuView-Package\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MenuView-Package</a></strong></li>\n<li>Enter the package URL and import it into your project.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2-creating-a-menu-script\">2. Creating a Menu Script</h3>\n<p>Each menu in your game should be defined as a script inheriting from <code>MenuView</code>. Here’s how you can set up your menu scripts:</p>\n<h4 id=\"example-1-main-game-menu\">Example 1: Main Game Menu</h4>\n<p>Create a script named <code>MainGameMenu.cs</code> and inherit from <code>MenuView</code> instead of <code>MonoBehaviour</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-csharp\"><code>using MenuViews;\n\npublic class MainGameMenu : MenuView\n{\n    protected override void Init()\n    {\n        // Initialize buttons, texts, events, and more\n        throw new System.NotImplementedException();\n    }\n    \n    // Available commands:\n    // ChangeCurrentView&lt;AuthMenu&gt;();\n    // ChangeToLastView();\n    // LastView { get; }\n    // GetCurrentView();\n}</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"example-2-authentication-menu\">Example 2: Authentication Menu</h4>\n<p>Similarly, create another menu script for authentication, like <code>AuthMenu.cs</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-csharp\"><code>using MenuViews;\n\npublic class AuthMenu : MenuView\n{\n    protected override void Init()\n    {\n        throw new System.NotImplementedException();\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"example-3-settings-menu\">Example 3: Settings Menu</h4>\n<p>Another common menu is a settings menu. Here’s how you can create one:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-csharp\"><code>using MenuViews;\n\npublic class SettingsMenu : MenuView\n{\n    protected override void Init()\n    {\n        // Initialize settings options here\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"example-4-pause-menu\">Example 4: Pause Menu</h4>\n<p>A pause menu can be added in a similar way:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-csharp\"><code>using MenuViews;\n\npublic class PauseMenu : MenuView\n{\n    protected override void Init()\n    {\n        // Initialize pause menu options here\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"managing-menus\">Managing Menus</h2>\n<p>Once your menus are set up, you can manage them using various commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ChangeCurrentView&lt;T&gt;()</code> - Switch to a specific menu view.</li>\n<li><code>ChangeToLastView()</code> - Return to the previous menu.</li>\n<li><code>LastView</code> - Retrieve the last active menu.</li>\n<li><code>GetCurrentView()</code> - Get the currently active menu.</li>\n<li><code>CloseThisView()</code> - Close the current menu.</li>\n<li><code>CloseAll()</code> - Close all menus in the current layer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-in-ui-buttons\">How to Use in UI Buttons</h2>\n<p>One of the key features of this package is the ability to call functions in UI buttons to switch menus easily. Here’s how you can do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attach a <code>Button</code> component to your UI button.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>OnClick()</strong> event of the button, add a function call like:\n<ul>\n<li><code>MainGameMenu.ChangeCurrentView&lt;AuthMenu&gt;();</code></li>\n<li><code>AuthMenu.ChangeToLastView();</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This makes switching between menus fast and seamless without writing extra logic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-use-menuview-package\">Why Use MenuView-Package?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy to integrate</strong> – Just import the package and modify your menu scripts.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplifies menu switching</strong> – No need for complex UI state management.</li>\n<li><strong>Supports multiple UI layers</strong> – Useful for games with deep menu structures.</li>\n<li><strong>Works within a single scene</strong> – No need for scene transitions for menu changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduces development time</strong> – Provides a streamlined approach to menu navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>MenuView-Package is a lightweight and powerful tool to handle UI menus in Unity seamlessly. Whether you’re building a simple game or a complex application, this tool can help streamline your UI navigation. Feel free to try it out and share your feedback!</p>\n<p> </p>",

In this project, <strong>HEcsGravitySim</strong>, we tackle this challenge using <strong>Unity's ECS (Entity Component System)</strong> and <strong>Job System</strong> to leverage multi-threading for real-time calculations. Instead of processing thousands of gravitational interactions on a single thread, which would be highly inefficient, we distribute the computations across multiple threads for a significant performance boost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-gravity-calculation-bottleneck\">The Problem: Gravity Calculation Bottleneck</h2>\n<p>In a naive implementation of a gravity simulation, each planet applies a force to every other planet. This results in a <strong>nested loop</strong> with <strong>O(n²) complexity</strong>, where each frame requires computing forces for every pair of planets.

Created in just seven days by a small team, it blends chaos and serenity, offering a unique, emotionally charged experience that stays with players long after gameplay.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Game jams are a breeding ground for innovation, where developers push their limits under extreme time constraints. Among the many titles born from such creative pressure, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> stands out as an emotionally charged, atmospheric 2D puzzle game that encapsulates both chaos and serenity. Developed during the <strong>Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1</strong>, this prototype is a testament to what a small team can achieve in just <strong>seven days</strong>.</p>\n<p>A collaborative effort by <strong>Hooman Jalalpoor, Mahdi Motazedi, Hesam Jalalpoor,</strong> and <strong>Golara Mozdbar</strong>, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> weaves a delicate balance between urgency and calmness, delivering a gaming experience that lingers long after the screen fades to black.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-story-a-race-against-the-rising-waters\">The Story: A Race Against the Rising Waters</h2>\n<p>Set in a world drowning under relentless rainfall, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> follows the journey of a young girl and her mystical fox companion. With floodwaters steadily rising, their only hope for survival lies in scavenging materials to construct a boat before it's too late.</p>\n<p>The game’s narrative unfolds through its environments rather than explicit storytelling. Crumbling structures, eerie silhouettes in the distance, and the ever-present sound of rain create a backdrop of desolation. Yet, within this bleak setting, hope flickers in the form of the girl and her fox—an unbreakable duo navigating the chaos together.</p>\n<p>Golara Mozdbar, the game’s designer, describes their approach: <em>“We wanted to reinterpret ‘chaos’ as something subtle but urgent. Instead of explosions and destruction, our chaos is the creeping inevitability of rising waters.”</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"gameplay-teamwork-and-tension\">Gameplay: Teamwork and Tension</h2>\n<p><em>Rainy Cloud</em> is more than just a puzzle game—it’s a test of strategy, quick thinking, and cooperation. Players must harness the unique abilities of both the girl and the fox to navigate the perilous landscape.</p>\n<h3 id=\"character-abilities\"><strong>Character Abilities:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Girl</strong> – Stronger and able to move heavy objects, she can reach higher platforms and construct elements needed for the boat.</li>\n<li><strong>The Fox</strong> – Agile and small, the fox can squeeze through narrow gaps, activate distant switches, and even provide magical assistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game seamlessly integrates these mechanics into puzzles that require players to think critically. Whether it’s triggering a mechanism to unlock a new path or coordinating actions to escape rising water, every decision counts.</p>\n<p>The ticking pressure of the flood adds an element of urgency—forcing players to balance exploration with efficiency. The result? A tense yet rewarding gameplay experience that makes every victory feel hard-earned.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/UkdF_-1.png\" data-size=\"1000x489\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/UkdF_-1-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"376\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/mPFAT3.png\" data-size=\"1000x489\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/mPFAT3-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"376\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/ugy3FH.png\" data-size=\"1000x485\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/ugy3FH-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"372\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/KqqqmE.png\" data-size=\"1000x486\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/KqqqmE-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"373\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/t4ZtEt.png\" data-size=\"1000x625\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/t4ZtEt-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/eX2mxi.png\" data-size=\"1000x625\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/eX2mxi-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2 id=\"art-sound-a-dreamlike-atmosphere\">Art &amp; Sound: A Dreamlike Atmosphere</h2>\n<p>Mahdi Motazedi, the game’s artist and animator, has crafted a world that is both whimsical and melancholic. The stark contrast between the glowing fox and the dark, rain-drenched surroundings heightens the sense of isolation, while the fluid animations add a layer of realism to the characters' emotions.</p>\n<p>The audio design, led by <strong>Hesam Jalalpoor</strong>, further enhances the experience. With soft piano melodies intertwined with the ever-present sound of rain and distant thunder, the game creates an atmosphere that is at once soothing and unsettling. <em>“We wanted the music to reflect both the desperation and the quiet determination of our characters,”</em> Hesam explains.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge-of-game-jams\">The Challenge of Game Jams</h2>\n<p>Game jams demand a tight workflow, and the <em>Rainy Cloud</em> team knew they had limited time to execute their vision. <strong>Hooman Jalalpoor</strong>, the Unity developer, emphasized the importance of prioritization:</p>\n<p><em>“We focused first on movement, puzzles, and the flood mechanic. Once that core loop was polished, we filled in the details with art and sound.”</em></p>\n<p>One of the team's standout achievements was implementing configurable controls, allowing players to seamlessly switch between <strong>keyboard, mouse, and controllers</strong>—a feature not often seen in jam projects.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"a-short-but-impactful-experience\">A Short but Impactful Experience</h2>\n<p>Although <em>Rainy Cloud</em> is labeled a <strong>prototype</strong>, it feels surprisingly complete. A single playthrough lasts just a few minutes, yet those minutes are packed with intricate puzzles, evocative visuals, and a lingering sense of urgency.</p>\n<p>Since its launch on <strong>itch.io</strong> (<a href=\"https://jammersclub.itch.io/rainy-cloud\">play here</a>), <em>Rainy Cloud</em> has received praise for its emotional depth and creative interpretation of the jam’s theme, <em>“Let There Be Chaos.”</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts-the-beauty-of-chaos\">Final Thoughts: The Beauty of Chaos</h2>\n<p>At its core, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> is a story about resilience, teamwork, and hope in the face of an overwhelming force. It is a reminder that even within the constraints of a game jam, beauty can emerge from chaos.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a fan of puzzle games, indie titles, or simply appreciate thoughtful storytelling, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> is well worth your time. <strong>Dive into the storm, embrace the challenge, and uncover the magic within the rain.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"game-details\"><strong>Game Details</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Title</strong>: Rainy Cloud</li>\n<li><strong>Platforms</strong>: Windows</li>\n<li><strong>Developers</strong>: Hooman Jalalpoor, Mahdi Motazedi, Hesam Jalalpoor, Golara Mozdbar</li>\n<li><strong>Tags</strong>: 2D, puzzle, atmospheric, indie, game jam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>🎮 <strong>Play Rainy Cloud here:</strong> <a href=\"https://jammersclub.itch.io/rainy-cloud\">itch.io link</a></p>",

As an artist and programmer, I’ve been deeply immersed in this world, creating generative art projects that blend procedural techniques with storytelling and aesthetics. Most of my work is published on <strong>fxhash</strong>, a platform dedicated to generative art, and I’m excited to share some of my projects with you.</p>\n<p>You can explore my artistic journey on my blog: <a href=\"https://parallax.tez.page\"><strong>parallax.tez.page</strong></a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-generative-art\"><strong>What is Generative Art?</strong></h3>\n<p>Generative art is a form of digital art where the artist creates a system or algorithm that autonomously generates artwork. Each piece is unique, often influenced by random variables or user inputs. This process allows for endless variations, making every output a one-of-a-kind creation.</p>\n<p>For me, generative art is more than just code—it’s a way to tell stories, evoke emotions, and explore the boundaries of creativity.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"my-generative-art-projects\"><strong>My Generative Art Projects</strong></h3>\n<p>Here are some of my projects that I’ve published on <strong>fxhash</strong>:</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-taiga\"><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/24070\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taiga</a></strong></h4>\n<p><em>Taiga</em> is a generative art project inspired by the vast, untamed wilderness of boreal forests.

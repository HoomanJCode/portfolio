Created by <strong>Hooman Jalalpoor</strong> (programmer/Unity developer) and <strong>Hesam Jalalpoor</strong> (music, SFX, and artist), this prototype earned <strong>1st place</strong> at Isfahan University’s Game Dev Camp Final Jam. With its unique blend of strategic gameplay, emotional storytelling, and striking art, <em>Impasse</em> stands as a testament to what small teams can achieve under pressure.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://hoomanj.itch.io/impasse" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-11" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play <em>Impasse</em> on Android</a></p><a href="https://hoomanj.itch.io/impasse" target="_blank" class="extlink extlink-icon-11" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch Page of Game</a></blockquote><hr><p><strong>The Story: A Tale of Friendship and Hope</strong><br><em>Impasse</em> centers on two friends navigating a world fraught with challenges. Tasked with battling a formidable boss, the duo must rely on teamwork and ingenuity to survive. The game’s narrative, inspired by the jam’s theme of <strong>“Hope,”</strong> weaves a heartfelt story about perseverance and trust. Players are drawn into a minimalist yet evocative world where solving puzzles isn’t just about progression—it’s about rekindling hope in the face of despair.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="3"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/3/gallery/N-MlQ6-1.png" data-size="306x500"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/3/gallery/N-MlQ6-1-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="306" height="500"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/3/gallery/KExCwP.gif" data-size="272x480"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/3/gallery/KExCwP.gif" alt=""></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/3/gallery/_yWHlB.gif" data-size="272x480"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/3/gallery/_yWHlB.gif" alt=""></a></figure></div></div><p><strong>Gameplay Mechanics and Game Design</strong><br>Blending puzzle-solving with action-packed combat, <em>Impasse</em> offers a fresh take on the genre:</p><ul><li><strong>Level Variety</strong>: The game features diverse level designs that evolve as players progress. The first level introduces a <strong>boat-driving segment</strong>, immersing players in an engaging movement-based challenge before transitioning into the core gameplay.</li><li><strong>Isometric Puzzle-Solving</strong>: The main gameplay revolves around an <strong>isometric puzzle system</strong>, where players control two characters simultaneously. Some blocks obstruct movement for one character while allowing the other to pass, requiring strategic coordination to solve each level.</li><li><strong>Boss Battle Mechanics</strong>: The game features a <strong>2D boss fight</strong> sequence, where the player moves between three positions on the screen to dodge the boss’s powerful punches. This mix of action and puzzle-solving keeps gameplay fresh and dynamic.</li><li><strong>Cooperative Elements</strong>: Whether playing solo or switching between characters, teamwork is essential for overcoming obstacles and reaching new areas.</li></ul><p>The game’s jam roots shine through its concise design—every mechanic serves the story and theme.</p><p><strong>Art and Sound: A Feast for the Senses</strong><br>Hesam Jalalpoor’s contributions elevate <em>Impasse</em> into an artistic triumph:</p><ul><li><strong>Visual Style</strong>: The isometric 2D art blends crisp geometry with muted, atmospheric colors, reflecting the game’s tone of struggle and hope. The environments are designed with a minimalist yet detailed approach, featuring soft gradients and carefully crafted textures that give the world a hand-painted feel. Character designs emphasize expressive animations, ensuring that movements feel fluid and natural. The color palette strategically shifts between warm and cool tones, reinforcing the emotional highs and lows of the journey. Lighting effects, subtle shadows, and particle details enhance the immersion, making the world feel alive despite its stylized simplicity.</li><li><strong>Music and SFX</strong>: Hesam’s haunting melodies and immersive sound effects deepen the emotional weight. From the clang of combat to the subtle hum of puzzles, the audio design pulls players into the world.<br>Explore Hesam’s portfolio: <a href="http://hesam.jalalpoor.com/?ref=hooman.jalalpoor.com" class="extlink extlink-icon-11">hesam.jalalpoor.com</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Technical Execution: Unity-Powered Precision</strong><br>Hooman Jalalpoor’s technical prowess ensured <em>Impasse</em>’s smooth gameplay:</p><ul><li><strong>What is Unity?</strong>: Unity is a powerful, cross-platform game engine widely used in game development. It offers a robust suite of tools for building both 2D and 3D experiences and is favored for its flexibility, real-time rendering, and support for multiple platforms, including <strong>Android</strong>, where <em>Impasse</em> was developed.</li><li><strong>Unity’s Role in <em>Impasse</em></strong>: Several of Unity’s technical features contributed to the game’s design and execution:<ul><li><strong>2D Isometric Rendering Pipeline</strong>: Enabled smooth, perspective-based visuals that enhance the depth of puzzles and environments.</li><li><strong>Physics-Based Interactions</strong>: Allowed for realistic movement mechanics, including the boat-driving section and interactive puzzle elements.</li><li><strong>Animation Tools</strong>: Provided smooth character animations, ensuring natural movement in both puzzle-solving and action sequences.</li><li><strong>Optimization Capabilities</strong>: Helped maintain a stable frame rate and ensure seamless performance on mobile devices.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Prototype Scope</strong>: Designed as a jam game, <em>Impasse</em> balances polish with creative experimentation, leaving room for future expansion.</li></ul><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/3/LGtbF1.gif" alt="" width="600" height="335"></figure><p><strong>Reception and Legacy</strong><br><em>Impasse</em>’s accolades speak volumes:</p><ul><li>🏆 <strong>1st Place</strong> at Isfahan University’s Game Dev Jam.</li><li>Praise for its innovative fusion of puzzle mechanics and narrative depth.</li></ul><p>While still a prototype, its success hints at potential for a full release.</p><blockquote><strong>Play <em>Impasse</em> Today!</strong><br>Ready to test your wits and courage?

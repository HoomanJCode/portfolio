Created in just seven days by a small team, it blends chaos and serenity, offering a unique, emotionally charged experience that stays with players long after gameplay.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Game jams are a breeding ground for innovation, where developers push their limits under extreme time constraints. Among the many titles born from such creative pressure, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> stands out as an emotionally charged, atmospheric 2D puzzle game that encapsulates both chaos and serenity. Developed during the <strong>Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1</strong>, this prototype is a testament to what a small team can achieve in just <strong>seven days</strong>.</p><p>A collaborative effort by <strong>Hooman Jalalpoor, Mahdi Motazedi, Hesam Jalalpoor,</strong> and <strong>Golara Mozdbar</strong>, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> weaves a delicate balance between urgency and calmness, delivering a gaming experience that lingers long after the screen fades to black.</p><hr><h2 id="the-story-a-race-against-the-rising-waters">The Story: A Race Against the Rising Waters</h2><p>Set in a world drowning under relentless rainfall, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> follows the journey of a young girl and her mystical fox companion. With floodwaters steadily rising, their only hope for survival lies in scavenging materials to construct a boat before it's too late.</p><p>The game’s narrative unfolds through its environments rather than explicit storytelling. Crumbling structures, eerie silhouettes in the distance, and the ever-present sound of rain create a backdrop of desolation. Yet, within this bleak setting, hope flickers in the form of the girl and her fox—an unbreakable duo navigating the chaos together.</p><p>Golara Mozdbar, the game’s designer, describes their approach: <em>“We wanted to reinterpret ‘chaos’ as something subtle but urgent. Instead of explosions and destruction, our chaos is the creeping inevitability of rising waters.”</em></p><hr><h2 id="gameplay-teamwork-and-tension">Gameplay: Teamwork and Tension</h2><p><em>Rainy Cloud</em> is more than just a puzzle game—it’s a test of strategy, quick thinking, and cooperation. Players must harness the unique abilities of both the girl and the fox to navigate the perilous landscape.</p><h3 id="character-abilities"><strong>Character Abilities:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>The Girl</strong> – Stronger and able to move heavy objects, she can reach higher platforms and construct elements needed for the boat.</li><li><strong>The Fox</strong> – Agile and small, the fox can squeeze through narrow gaps, activate distant switches, and even provide magical assistance.</li></ul><p>The game seamlessly integrates these mechanics into puzzles that require players to think critically. Whether it’s triggering a mechanism to unlock a new path or coordinating actions to escape rising water, every decision counts.</p><p>The ticking pressure of the flood adds an element of urgency—forcing players to balance exploration with efficiency. The result? A tense yet rewarding gameplay experience that makes every victory feel hard-earned.</p><div class="gallery-wrapper"><div class="gallery" data-is-empty="false" data-translation="Add images" data-columns="4"><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/UkdF_-1.png" data-size="1000x489"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/UkdF_-1-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="376"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/mPFAT3.png" data-size="1000x489"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/mPFAT3-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="376"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/ugy3FH.png" data-size="1000x485"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/ugy3FH-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="372"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/KqqqmE.png" data-size="1000x486"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/KqqqmE-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="373"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/t4ZtEt.png" data-size="1000x625"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/t4ZtEt-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="480"></a></figure><figure class="gallery__item"><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/eX2mxi.png" data-size="1000x625"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/posts/5/gallery/eX2mxi-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="768" height="480"></a></figure></div></div><h2 id="art-sound-a-dreamlike-atmosphere">Art &amp; Sound: A Dreamlike Atmosphere</h2><p>Mahdi Motazedi, the game’s artist and animator, has crafted a world that is both whimsical and melancholic. The stark contrast between the glowing fox and the dark, rain-drenched surroundings heightens the sense of isolation, while the fluid animations add a layer of realism to the characters' emotions.</p><p>The audio design, led by <strong>Hesam Jalalpoor</strong>, further enhances the experience. With soft piano melodies intertwined with the ever-present sound of rain and distant thunder, the game creates an atmosphere that is at once soothing and unsettling. <em>“We wanted the music to reflect both the desperation and the quiet determination of our characters,”</em> Hesam explains.</p><hr><h2 id="the-challenge-of-game-jams">The Challenge of Game Jams</h2><p>Game jams demand a tight workflow, and the <em>Rainy Cloud</em> team knew they had limited time to execute their vision. <strong>Hooman Jalalpoor</strong>, the Unity developer, emphasized the importance of prioritization:</p><p><em>“We focused first on movement, puzzles, and the flood mechanic. Once that core loop was polished, we filled in the details with art and sound.”</em></p><p>One of the team's standout achievements was implementing configurable controls, allowing players to seamlessly switch between <strong>keyboard, mouse, and controllers</strong>—a feature not often seen in jam projects.</p><hr><h2 id="a-short-but-impactful-experience">A Short but Impactful Experience</h2><p>Although <em>Rainy Cloud</em> is labeled a <strong>prototype</strong>, it feels surprisingly complete. A single playthrough lasts just a few minutes, yet those minutes are packed with intricate puzzles, evocative visuals, and a lingering sense of urgency.</p><p>Since its launch on <strong>itch.io</strong> (<a href="https://jammersclub.itch.io/rainy-cloud" class="extlink extlink-icon-11">play here</a>), <em>Rainy Cloud</em> has received praise for its emotional depth and creative interpretation of the jam’s theme, <em>“Let There Be Chaos.”</em></p><h2 id="final-thoughts-the-beauty-of-chaos">Final Thoughts: The Beauty of Chaos</h2><p>At its core, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> is a story about resilience, teamwork, and hope in the face of an overwhelming force. It is a reminder that even within the constraints of a game jam, beauty can emerge from chaos.</p><p>Whether you’re a fan of puzzle games, indie titles, or simply appreciate thoughtful storytelling, <em>Rainy Cloud</em> is well worth your time. <strong>Dive into the storm, embrace the challenge, and uncover the magic within the rain.</strong></p><hr><h3 id="game-details"><strong>Game Details</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Title</strong>: Rainy Cloud</li><li><strong>Platforms</strong>: Windows</li><li><strong>Developers</strong>: Hooman Jalalpoor, Mahdi Motazedi, Hesam Jalalpoor, Golara Mozdbar</li><li><strong>Tags</strong>: 2D, puzzle, atmospheric, indie, game jam</li></ul><p>🎮 <strong>Play Rainy Cloud here:</strong> <a href="https://jammersclub.itch.io/rainy-cloud" class="extlink extlink-icon-11">itch.io link</a></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on May 2, 2025</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/tags/game/">Game</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/balls-of-chaos-a-game-jam-triumph-in-100-seconds-of-mayhem/" class="invert" rel="prev">Balls of Chaos: A Game Jam Triumph in 100 Seconds of Mayhem</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/hecsgravitysim-a-high-performance-gravity-simulation-in-unity/" class="invert" rel="next">HEcsGravitySim: A High-Performance Gravity Simulation in Unity</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><img src="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/media/website/dfjhkk-2-2xl.png" loading="eager" height="600" width="600" alt="Hooman Jalalpoor"><div><h3><a href="https://hooman.jalalpoor.com/authors/hooman-jalalpoor/" class="invert" title="Hooman Jalalpoor">Hooman Jalalpoor</a></h3><p>Hi, I’m Hooman Jalalpoor—an Indie Game Programmer, Software Engineer, and Generative Artist.
